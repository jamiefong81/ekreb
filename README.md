Reflection:
When beginning this project, I did not know much -- if anything -- about Javascript, React, or Express. I began this project late, 3 days before the deadline, because of midterms. Despite this, I managed to create work hard and dedicate time to this project. I am proud of what I have made and what I have learned along the way. However, I am even more proud of how I managed to dedicate myself to this project, starting late with limited knowledge, and ended up creating a functioning program. There are more features I wished to add. I wanted to include a timer in this game and a more intricate points system that took into account the fact that some words are longer and thus harder to unscramble. Additionally, given more time, I would have liked to add more songs and create a better audio player system. The music was more of a last minute thought, if anything. I don't want this to be the end, however. I plan, if time permits, to add these features and more and to improve this game. Furthermore, now that I have gained new web development skills, I plan to create even more projects using React as a frontend.
